Date #2
=======

This was the receipt from my second date with Vaidehi. We started going out on New Year’s day (easy to remember I know!) 2009 and the first couple of times, we used to meet at this place called “Coffee Nations”. For me, it was walking distance from my office and close to the train station. For her, it was conveniently located along the way home. And the place was small, cozy and rarely crowded. The cafe no longer exists, but at the time, it was perfect as a place to meet up - especially on weekdays, when you still had to go to work the next day.

Back to this receipt. Two drinks and some sides to share. Our usual order. It was early-ish for dinner. I got a cider or beer (they had a few that were not readily found elsewhere). Besides, I wasn’t there to eat. I was there to talk the evening away, and find out as much as I could about her.

As romantic as it all sounds, when I look back now, it’s just ridiculous how we have changed, the two of us. How much progress we have made and the adults we are now becoming. Long distance was a pain in the backside and we somehow survived. It took a number of breaks and one serious break-up to help figure things about, but here we are three and a half years later and much better people for it.
